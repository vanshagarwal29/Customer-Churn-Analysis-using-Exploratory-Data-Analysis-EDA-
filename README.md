# Customer Churn Analysis using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn refers to the situation when customers stop using a company’s services. 
In this project, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed on a telecom churn dataset 
(BigML Churn dataset) to understand customer behavior and identify factors that contribute 
to customer churn.

The analysis focuses on customer usage patterns, service plans, charges, and customer 
support interactions to derive meaningful business insights.
